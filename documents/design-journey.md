Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are acceptable.


# Planning

## Client Description (Milestone 1) <!-- Shichen -->
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client? What kind of website do they want? What are their key goals?

Our client is Cornell's Mainland China Student Association. It is a cultural organization aiming to bridging the Chinese student body and the Cornell community together, and they welcome everyone interested to get on board. During every semester, they organize events that increase understanding of Chinese culture and give students resources and opportunities to be more involved in the Cornell Community. Members have close relationships with each other and grow a lot by organizing events together.


## Site's Purpose (Milestone 1) <!-- Shichen -->
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.

The purpose of the website is to provide potential members of MCSA some information about the club and to encourage these members to take action into applying. To promote this purpose, we will provide information about the club's mission, goals, members, events, and contact information. These will all serve to ultimately convince visitors to apply to join the club in the last section of the website.

## Client Meeting Notes (Milestone 1) <!-- Shichen -->
> Include your notes/minutes from the client meeting, an email they sent you, or whatever you used to keep track of what was discussed at the meeting.

1. Overview of MCSA - cultural org targeting mainland Chinese students on campus
2. Pages desired - homepage (group photo and description), about, members (link to email address), alumni highlights (may be combined with members page), events, get involved/apply now page
3. Content acquisition - the client sent us a powerpoint that is used during information session with useful club information and photos; we created a drive folder to store more information shared in the future; team will work on copywriting to be approved by client
4. Branding/visual aesthetic - will send logos; we will mainly use red and white to match their logo and powerpoint
5. Future meetings/touch base - will coordinate future meetings and communicate regularly via email/Messenger, looking to a meeting next weekend

# Design & Evaluation

## Design Process (Milestone 1) <!-- Emily and Sabrina -->
> Document your design process. Show us your card sorting. Design your navigation from the card sorting. Outline your navigation. Describe your theme. Show us sketches of your site (mobile and desktop versions). etc.
> You should show us how your came up with your design and how your iterated on that design; show us the evolution of your design.

> **Note:** Card sorting is used to organize your site's content. For each piece of content identified in the previous section, write a summary of that content onto a card. Now sort the cards. The grouping of cards provides you with your pages for your website. **Do not write down the pages you want and then "card sort" those. That is not card sorting.**

### Design Goals & Theme

Our client wants their online presence to be professional, but not too serious as they are a cultural organization. The website should also attract the interest of potential club members. Our design goals are built around this idea of balancing professionalism and approachability. The website should have a clean look and information should be easy to find.  

When asked about what colors they would like to be included in the color scheme of the website, the client said that red and white should definitely be included, as those are the colors present in their logo. To keep the website easy to read, we will have the background a shade of white and use the red as an accent color. To keep the website easy and comfortable to view for the audience, we will avoid bright or contrasting colors as we move forward in our design. A Sans Serif font is fitting for the theme of the website because it provides easy to read text without having the formality associated with a serif font.

Members: ![](members-mobile-draft.jpg) <!-- Anyi -->

Events:![](events-mobile-draft.jpg) <!-- Emily -->

Apply: ![](apply-mobile-draft.jpg) <!-- Sabrina -->

## Interactivity (Milestone 1) <!-- Anyi -->
> What interactive features will your site have? Describe how the interactivity connects with the needs of the clients/target audience.

Our site will have two interactive features. The first is a gallery feature that allows website visitors to look through pictures of the members at events. The second is an application form allowing users to apply to join the organization. This connects with the needs of the target audience because MCSA is looking to attract underclassmen who are interested in joining, so keeping the application form on the same website is a good way to keep information centralized and encourage more people to apply in an easily accessible form.

## User Testing (_optional_)
> This testing is optional.

### User 1 - Testing Notes (Milestone 1)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.

# Final Evaluation

## Changes Based on Lab 13 Peer Feedback (Final Submission)
> What changes did you make to your design based on your peers' feedback?

From the lab demo, we changed several things. One change was the order of our pages on the navigation bar. To make it less confusing for users to navigate, we decided to change the order of the page from "About, E-board, Home..." to "Home, About, E-board". We also realized that we needed to make the interactivity sections of our site more apparent. To accomplish that, We made the gallery in the events page stand out by having two buttons so that it can help users navigate in between the pictures. We also worked to align the application form so that users can find it easier filling out the application form. We also cited our images on our website. Lastly, we all made sure that our pages were mobile friendly.

## User Testing
> If you conducted user testing in Milestone 1, you only need to user test 2 more users. Otherwise, you must conduct user testing with 4 users.

### User 3 - Testing Notes (Final Submission)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.

![](u3.jpg)
### User 3 (Final Submission)

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

User 3's name is Joe, studying Information Science in the College of Arts and Sciences. He is a Chinese American who is interested in learning more about his Chinese Culture. He hopes that he can accomplish that by joining MCSA in the upcoming semesters.

2. Does the user belong to your target audience of the site? (Yes / No)
> If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your target audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the target audience?

Yes

### User 3 - **Desktop** (Final Submission)

## Changes Based on User Testing (Final Submission)
> What changes did you make to your design based on user testing?

We bolded the mission statement header, aligned the social media icons in the desktop version of the footer, and ensured the submit button was visible on the page.

## Final Notes to the Graders (Final Submission)
> 1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.

1. Organized Navigation and Information Hierarchy: our site is well organized, thanks to our card sorting. During user testing, we found that users could easily make correct predictions about where to locate specific content on the site. This creates a very pleasant experience for the user while using our website.
2. Visual Design: the visual design of our website is very reflective of MCSA as an organization. The red found in their logo can also be found throughout the website for cohesiveness. We also utilized visual design principles of proximity and white space to show relationships between content on the About page. Overall, our font choices, content layout, and color choices all work together to create a clean website and is pleasing for users to look at.
3. Consolidation of Information: MCSA has a lot of available information floating around between Google Slide presentations, their WeChat account, Facebook account, and Instagram account, but its previous public-facing web presence was scattered and lacked cohesion. We improved their web presence by synthesizing and consolidating into one convenient location that comprehensively explains relevant information about MCSA.


> 2. Tell us about things that don't work, what you wanted to implement, or what you would do if you keep working with the client in the future. Give justifications.

At first, we wanted to implement a translation page, for students who want to view the website in Chinese. However, we realized that although MCSA has many group native Chinese speakers, the prospective members are people who could read and speak English. Although it would be cool having an interactive feature like that, we chose to focus on other parts of interactivity, such as the gallery and the application form. We also felt that including Chinese may be alienating to students who are not as fluent, and the client expressed the desire to reach a wider audience, so we were comfortable deciding not to move forward with that function.

> 3. Tell us what you, as a team, learned while working on this project.

We learned to communicate effectively as a team. We made sure to have frequent meetings, updated each other when changes were made, and aided one another on tasks. This contributed to the overall cohesion of our project, especially with as many moving parts and changes as we had during the development of the website.

> 4. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.
