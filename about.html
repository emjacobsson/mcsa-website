                <p>We have a special Big and Little System that helps new students navigate their brand-new college life here and foster relationships between students of different ages, interests and backgrounds. Bigs (upperclassmen) provide personal guidance and mentorship to Littles (underclassmen). Underclassmen are paired with upperclassman to form a genuine bond and help them ease into college life. </p>
